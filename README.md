### 🚀 Fun Fact
A fun fact about QA testing is that it's often compared to being a professional detective. You're not just looking for obvious mistakes; you're actively searching for the hidden clues that could lead to a bug, thinking creatively about all the ways a user might try to "break" the software. This detective work requires a unique combination of curiosity, critical thinking, and a bit of playful mischief.
